# Hosted Flyer Package

Two options to publish your announcement on GitHub Pages:

- **index.html** → hosts a single poster image (fastest). Put your final JPG/PNG in `assets/poster.jpg`.
- **flyer_text.html** → fully editable HTML version with bilingual toggle (English/Malayalam).

## Deploy
1. Copy the contents to your repo root (e.g., `garammasala/`).
2. Update links in both files (Google Form + WhatsApp).
3. Commit & push. Ensure GitHub Pages is `main` and `/ (root)`.
4. View:
   - `/` → image poster
   - `/flyer_text.html` → text version
